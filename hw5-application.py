# Your turn! #

# Now you're ready for the next part, where you retrieve data from an API
# of your choice. Note that you may need to provide an authentication key
# for some APIs. For that, work another file, called  keys.py and add it 
# to .gitignore so that it does not get checked into Git.
#
# You will need to copy a few of the import statements from the top of this
# file. You may copy any helpful functions, too, like safe_get().
#
# See requirements in the README.
#
# Also note that when the sunrise sunset API we used is queried for a
# date that doesn't exist, it gives a 400 error. Some APIs that you may
# use will return JSON-formatted data saying that the requested item
# couldn't be found. You may have to check the contents of the data you 
# get back to see whether a query was successful. You don't have to do
# that with the sunrise sunset API.
